# Feedback-Prize-ELL

## Overview

This repository is a code repository created for the Kaggle competition aimed at assessing the language proficiency of 8th-12th grade Feedback Prize English Language Learners ([ELLs](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/feedback-prize-english-language-learning/overview)). The repository contains code and models developed by participants to improve automated feedback tools for ELLs using machine learning, natural language processing, and educational data analytics.

### Data

The dataset, known as the ELLIPSE corpus, is composed of argumentative essays written by English Language Learners (ELLs) in grades 8th to 12th. These essays have been scored based on six specific analytic measures: cohesion, syntax, vocabulary, phraseology, grammar, and conventions. These measures represent different aspects of essay writing proficiency, and higher scores indicate higher proficiency in each respective measure. The scores range from 1.0 to 5.0 in increments of 0.5.

### Goal

The goal of the competition is to predict the scores for each of the six measures for the essays in the test set. By developing models that can accurately predict these scores, participants aim to contribute to the improvement of automated feedback tools for ELLs.
